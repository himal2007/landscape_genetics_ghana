## Introduction
Onchocerciasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by a filarial parasite *O. volvulus* and transmitted by the bites of black flies (*Simulium* spp.). The blackflies have a narrow range of ecological suitability leads to the spatial heterogeneity in the prevalence and transmission of onchocerciasis (cite some of the Cheke papers as well) (Cromwell et al., 2021; Shrestha et al., 2022; Zouré et al., 2014). The onchocerciasis control is being done with mass drug administration with ivermectin (MDAi) in selected communities, i.e. there is a spatial heterogeneity in interventions as well. The target of onchocerciasis elimination with MDAi is 'hindered' by some of the persistent onchocerciasis transmission foci despite decades of intervention. 

Spatial heterogeneity is important to consider to understand persistence of disease transmission, because of the risk that movement of infected vectors or the parasites from the areas with different endemicity and MDAi history can re-initiate disease in areas where onchocerciasis is thought to be eliminated. For instance in onchocerciasis, the migration of the parasites via humans has been linked to recrudescence in previously eliminated foci of Burkina Faso (Koala et al., 2017; Nikièma et al., 2018, Koala et al. 2019). Similarly, failure to achieve elimination of onchocerciasis in West Africa with onchocerciasis control program (OCP) was attributed to rapid insecticide resistance due to high vector migration and thus the spread of insecticide resistance alleles (Cupp et al., 2011). However, disease control programs have historically focused on government administrative units as the unit of intervention which has led to a situation where treatment decisions are being made without much consideration to host mediated movement of the parasites and thus, the transmission.

A geographical unit where the disease transmission occurs via locally breeding vectors are termed as transmission zones (APOC and WHO 2010). They form the biological basis of intervention units and thus are very crucial to ensure that the interventions are at correct geographic scale. Onchocerciasis has a huge socio-economic impact in the poorest of the poor nations of the world (Cupp et al., 2011; Dunn et al., 2015). Therefore, the limited resources available in theses areas must be judiciously allocated to the most essential areas to achieve elimination of onchocerciasis transmission. The way forward to achieving the elimination goal is to align intervention units as close as possible to the natural transmission zones. However, delineating a transmission zone is a challenging task, and several tools have been deployed to understand transmission zones.

We can gain some insights into the transmission zones based on prevalence mapping, where point prevalence data are interpolated spatially (O’Hanlon et al., 2016; Zouré et al., 2014). However, this is a static map and ignores the 'innate' connectivity between locations mediated by the movement of human host and the vectors. Population genetics have been used to infer the movement of the pathogen where movement can be indirectly measured by the genetic relatedness of samples across locations (Crawford et al., 2019; Hedtke et al., 2020; Small et al., 2019, more borad citations do not limit to just filarial nematodes, Adler et al., 2010; Agatsuma, 1987; Charalambous et al., 2005; Choi et al., 2016; Doyle et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the dispersal and thus, the geneflow of the parasites and the vectors are a subject of influence by the environmental features of the landscape. Therefore, population genetics alone cannot provide a complete picture of the transmission processes without incorporating spatial information and the environmental data which could be done with landscape gentics approach.  

Landscape genetics combine population genetics, landscape ecology and spatial analytical techniques to explicitly quantify the effects of landscape on evolutionary processes like gene-flow, drift, and selection (Balkenhol, 2016). Spatial information can be added in the form of sample geographic coordinates, remote sensing satellite image of different environmental and climate variables such as elevation, slope, distance to the water bodies etc. Landscape genetics involves a series of steps on how it could be used to infer transmission zones (Schwabl et al., 2017). First, we need to measure the genetic differentiation of the parasite and the vector populations sampled from different locations. Second, we can use those parameters of genetic differentiation to see which environmental features might govern the spatial pattern of genetic differentiation. Third, we can transform the most important environmental variables to resistance surface maps, which quantify the barriers to the geneflow of the study population in a pixel level landscape map (Hemming-Schroeder et al., 2018; Peterman, 2018). Finally, Resistance maps can be used to simulate the pattern of gene flow of the parasites and the vectors, giving us crucial insights on the corridors of movement between locations, their connectivity and thus, the possibility of transmission events (B. H. McRae et al., 2008).

We have implemented this technique to infer onchocerciasis transmission in the transition ecological region of Ghana where there is persistence of onchocerciasis transmission despite onchocerciasis interventions for almost half a century. Consequently, there have also been reports of suboptimal response in these areas (Awadzi, Attah, et al., 2004; Awadzi, Boakye, et al., 2004; Osei-Atweneboana et al., 2011). Initial population genetics analysis of the parasite samples from these areas suggested a lack of isolation-by-distance (IBD) i.e. they were genetically homogeneous (Crawford et al., 2019). This suggests cross-transmission of onchocerciasis between communities, a likely reason for the persistence of onchocerciasis. Further, not only were the samples collected at a greater distance similar, but some locations though being geographically close, were genetically isolated. Our hypothesis is that the environmental factors might play a role in resulting to such patterns.

We have incorporated environmental data to the parasite genetic data and additional vector samples sequenced from the transition ecological regions with an objective to: i. determine ecological factors affecting the spatial variation in the parasite and the vector population genetic estimates; ii. infer patterns and routes of gene-flow for the parasite and the vector populations. We have identified key environmental variables that influences the population genetic structure of the parasite and the vector population. We generated gene flow maps for the parasite and the vector population from the ecological resistance surface maps and identified potential corrridors of movement between the communities. Further, we have compared the resistance surface maps with the baseline microfilarial prevalence maps and discussed the immediate implications of the approach developed to aid elimination goals.

## Methods
### Sampling locations
The study area is a west-east transect in the ecological “transition zone” of Ghana: an area that includes the Savannah ecotype in the north, the forest ecotype in the south ( cite early literatures, Klutse et al., 2014), the Volta Lake bisecting the eastern parts of the transition zone, and the Bui National Park in the west (Figure 1). We chose this area for the study as there is ongoing persistence of onchocerciasis transmission despite decades of control efforts (Osei-Atweneboana et al., 2007; Otabil et al., 2019; Yaméogo, 2008). The elevation ranges from 70–525 m above sea level, and mean annual temperature and precipitation ranges from 24–29°C and 1077–1355 mm, respectively (Farr et al., 2007; Fick & Hijmans, 2017)

## Discussion
For the first time in oncho - we use LG - 
high prev in central part with confluence - might need vect interventions as well

No IBD - single and large TZ

First clinical trials and SOR began - Ghana - double penalty

Eliminating oncho transmission in connecting areas - widespread MDAi with vector intervention needed

LG and PG output not representing the current processes

at limitations = Single spatial scale - relation may differ in other scale - lack of significant correlation in dist to nearest river



## Miscellaneous


In addition, there is a spatial heterogeneity in interventions as well, i.e. not all communities undergo.
Onchocerciasis is a neglected filarial disease transmitted by the bites of blackflies and occurs predominantly in Africa and some parts of the Americas (Hill et al., 2019). Upon infection, the human host exhibits a range of chronic clinical manifestations such as severe skin itching, skin depigmentation, blindness and epilepsy or nodding syndrome in children (Basáñez et al., 2006; Colebunders et al., 2019). Despite interventions such as, vector control and mass drug administration with ivermectin (MDAi), onchocerciasis transmission persists in some foci.

# Synthesizing Environmental, Epidemiological, and Vector and Parasite Genetic Data

This repository contains the code used for the publication titled "[Synthesizing environmental, epidemiological and vector and parasite genetic data to assist decision making for disease elimination.](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.17357)". The research focuses on integrating diverse datasets to aid decision-making processes in onchocerciasis elimination efforts, a vector-borne disease.
